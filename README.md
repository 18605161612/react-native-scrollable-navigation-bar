# react-native-scrollable-navigation-bar

## Update - 07/06/2019

I completely rewrote this package since adding new features was way too troublesome. With the rewrite the package got a new, very easy to use, API. When I have some more time I will document everything, but for now you will have to rely on the provided examples.

**[Give the new version a try on Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@zobeirhamid/react-native-scrollable-navigation-bar)**

## Description

This package provides a set of navigation bars for ScrollViews with different animations.
